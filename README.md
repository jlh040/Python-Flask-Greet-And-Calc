- ### In this repository I have two applications that both involve working with routes in Flask.
  - The 'calc' application has four routes set up (/add, /sub, /mult, /div) that correspond to the four basic math operations. A request should be made to one of the
  four routes, and two numbers a and b, should be passed in as query parameters. Then the corresponding operation is performed with a and b and the result is
  returned.
  - The 'greet' application has four routes set up (/welcome, /welcome/home, /welcome/back). Once a request is made to one of the routes, a simple message is returned.
